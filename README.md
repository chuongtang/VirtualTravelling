# World Travelling 🛩️ ⛵

A little imagination during covid! 👻
What if we can travel to places 🗺️ see different scenes 🎑...in the digital world. 

This site was created when I was working on Project 1 of my cohort. Imaginations and memories can be shared to others who travel..virtually through my little coding work.

## Project Detail:

### Backend 🖥
* Built with Node.js and Express.js
* Hoisted on Heruku by Git
* Database at https://c6project1api.herokuapp.com/api/memories/

### Frontend : 🖥️
* A responsive advanced CSS navigation
* DOM manipulation by pure Javascript, no framework.

### New cool thing that I learned
* <NPM joi> allow you to create blueprints or schemas for Javascript Object to ensure validation of key information.

* <const JoiSchema = Joi.object({...});> use this to fix the Joi.validate is not a function.
* Resource used:
    * Google Font
    * Unsplash image
    * Prexel Videos
