# World Travelling 🛩️ ⛵

Before Covid-19, we were the ones who loved packing light, jumping on a plane. Or out of one. Landing in a new city. Choosing the dish on the menu we’re least familiar with. Delighting in a deep conversation with a stranger at a bar we’ve never been to before. 
So what’s options do we have when the world’s in lockdown?

But then I realized, you can just as easily travel through conversation with someone who lives in another part of the world. You can travel through their stories, their experiences, their joy, their memories.

This site was created when I was working on **Project 1** of my **Cohort 6**. Imagines and memories can be shared to others who travel..virtually via my little code work.

## Project Detail:

### Backend 🖥
* Built with Node.js and Express.js
* Hoisted on Heruku by Git
* Database at https://c6project1api.herokuapp.com/api/memories/

### Frontend : 🖥️

### New cool things that I learned 🎉
* <NPM joi> allow you to create blueprints or schemas for Javascript Object to ensure validation of key information.

* <const JoiSchema = Joi.object({...});> use this to fix the Joi.validate is not a function.
